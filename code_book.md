The steps taken are updated in the script file :"run_analysis.R". 
This file explains the variables used in the script and the steps taken to complete the assignment. 
Steps followed in run_analysis.R script:
Variable "f" to store the file path (inside the working directory); 
The training dataset is first loaded into the var "training_set"; 
The activities and subjects are taken in "training_subjects" and "training_activities". 
Similarly test dataset is also loaded. The activities names are loaded into var "activities"; 
The required features are compiled in "req_features", after loading the features. 
The training and the test set are modified based on the req_features list. 
Then they are merged. "merged_data" is the required dataset. 
They are given readable column names, based on variables. 
The Subject and Activity columns are taken as factors; 
Using the "reshape2" library, the dataset is melted and stored in "melt_merged_data" and are cast into the tidy dataset, "final_merged_data". 
The tidy dataset consists of averaged out values for each variable for each subject and activity. 
The output file is written as text file titled "TidyDataSet.txt".
